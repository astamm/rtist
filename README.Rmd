The goal of `rtists` is to provide visualization tools for tissue
integrity superimposed on tractography streamlines.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `rtists` from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

## Example

The following code generates a basic 3D visualisation of the left
uncinate fasciculus:

```{r example}
library(rtists)
library(future)
plan(multisession)
out <- autoplotly::autoplotly(uf_left)
plan(sequential)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
html_path <- knitr::fig_path("html")
png_path <- knitr::fig_path("png")
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(
  out, 
  file = html_path, 
  selfcontained = FALSE, 
  libdir = "lib"
)
webshot2::webshot(url = html_path, file = png_path)
```
